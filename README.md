This is a  [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, developed to submit as an assignment to Tulip Tech

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install the dependencies

First, you will need to install **node_modules**

To install node_modules, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install

# for iOS need to install pod dependencies using
cd ios && pod install
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm react-native run-android

# OR using Yarn
yarn react-native run-android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm react-native run-ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn react-native run-ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run the app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
